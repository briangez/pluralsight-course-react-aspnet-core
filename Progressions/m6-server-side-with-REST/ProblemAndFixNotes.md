01-Introducing  

  
## Video Improvements and Issues Coming (not done yet). Corrections fixed in GitHub Repo


m6-01 - 
m6-01 - at "0:10".. that's a mouthful ... "In the last module, where we added REST services to the client side rendering only, we added redux as a clean way to manage our state transitions.  Truthfully, we also added redux because we are going to need clean state management to implement our REST calls working on the server side. Don't worry if you don't know what I mean yet, that will become clear in the next few clips.  Meanwhile for the sake of introducing server side rendering that involves calls, let's time travel back to our code in the previous module before we added redux.  That, the clip titled 'Implementing Axios for getting data on the speaker component".  start at 0:18 {"That is"}

at 1:59 ...where are express server launched from... <cut out   to 2:03, start at "browsing to the speaker page.."

at 2:34 to 2:57, change to axios call on screen shot.

In Revised Clip: (aspdotnet-core-react-building-website-m6-01RevH.mp4 final)
  0:10 to 0:50 seconds is new audio and video
  2:25 has a few seconds deleted
  3:01 to 3:22 screen changed
  2:13 to  3:00 and 3:29 to 4:27 added white matte background because of black edge line showing
  
  Clip VERIFIED
  
  ------
  m6-03 at to start (0:00 - 0:15) lets time travel forward again to the code that we completed at the end of the last module "Making REST API Calls", and the clip titled "Adding Development Time only Middleware to React Redux"
  
  m6-03 at 6:33, add audio: "server webpack entry point..."   Notice also, we are creating a redux store, and then passing that store, and an empty context into the renderer.  unlike our Client.js we just looked at, for client side rendering that is, we do not have our Routes component here, which of course also was wrapped in a redux Provider element in our clients.js.  Looking at our updated Renderer.js, notice we do have our Router and we have replaced the routes, which were defined in the FullPage element,  with our renderRoutes method call.  Also notice that our Router is  enclosed in the Redux Provider element, which has the stored assigned as an attribute.
  
  m6-03 - Clip Updates
    at 06:33 to 07:43, new audio and visual
    full clip, put white matt end video to clean up some black strips on edges
    
    Verified

  m6-04 - at 04:28 to end, replaced code slide. No audio change in clip at all. Fixed side black lines by adding white matt to all of clip.

  m6-05 - at 03:13, Added short text: "Don't forget that you need to first install the npm package serialize-javascript and of course import it for use." ; added white background frame under full clip to hide black line on edge in places.
