# Problems and Fixes Notes (9/1/2018, video updates coming soon so this will not be needed)


m1-Add at 1:12 before "You will learn in this course...".  "Something to keep in mind, this is an intermediate level course.  If you plan on coding along with me, I strongly suggest keeping the github repo "Progressions" folder close at hand. I cover react topics often quickly and make the assumption that you can connect the dots where needed. If you do get stuck, take a look at the Progressions folder for the code at the end of each clip and you'll get right back on board with me.  If you are not an intermediate react and modern javascript programmer, you can still get a lot from this course. I just suggest not trying to code along with me, and just watch to understand concepts as well as get an idea of what you'll need going forward.
